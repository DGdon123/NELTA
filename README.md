# NELTA
 Nepal English Language Teachers' Association (NELTA) was founded in 1992. The British Council Nepal played an instrumental role in the establishment of this Association. The main objective behind its establishment was to set up a common platform for all the teachers of English in Nepal so as to support their professional development. Since its establishment, it has been recognized as a non-governmental, non-political, non-profit making professional association with the aim of enhancing ELT in Nepal. The need to improve the teaching and learning of the English language, thereby keeping abreast of new development in ELT, lay the foundation of NELTA. The following points justify the emergence of NELTA.
